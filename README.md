The project report can be found in InfoRetPaulFuhr.pdf.

The following associates work described in the report with corresponding code files:

In the first Experiment (section 4.2) the three models 20BC, 20BCoad and TC were trained. Code for this can be found in 20BC.ipynb, 20BCoad.ipynb and TC.ipynb respectively.

In the second experiment (section 4.3) I tried out the two ideas Hyperparameter Optimization (section 4.3.1) with code in TC_HO.ipynb and 1:1-ratio (section 4.3.2) with code in TC_one_to_one.ipynb.

In section 4.1.2 I described how each instance of the dataset arguments.tsv was paraphrased. Code for this can be found in Pegasus_Paraphrase.ipynb.

The file arguments.tsv contains the arguments for our first dataset (section 4.1.1), the file paraphrases.tsv contains the arguments for the second dataset (section 4.1.2) and the file labels.tsv contains labels for both datasets.
